What is Vew?

Geocached videos.
Vew is a location based video sharing app for explorers and curious humans.
Stand in someone else's footsteps and see what they saw. Leave messages for your friends, neighbors.
Give a stranger a glimpse of your city. Feel like wandering? Get off your butt and go explore the city. Start discussions.
Meet weirdos.

How it works:
1. Record your Vew. When you record the location is captured with the video.
2. Upload your Vew. Uploaded vews will be available to anyone with the app, (with access to that location.)


Inspiration:

As someone that often travels to new and different places, I found myself in Hawaii, watching videos from my social apps that where primarily from Minnesota.
I wanted to see the videos of Hawaii. I wanted a reason to wander around. I discovered a couple geocaches in Hawaii, and thought it would be cool to make
a modern and accessible geocaching experience.
